        <h1>Dayan, David</h1>
        <p>I am David Dayan. Three interesting facts about myself include that I have a twin sister, I am half Japanese and half American, and I have too many (5) computers on my desk. I chose to study CS because I enjoy learning about computers and programming interesting things. I've always loved computers and my dad worked in SWE.</p>
